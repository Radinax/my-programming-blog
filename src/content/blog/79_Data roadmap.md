# Introduction

I have been thinking a lot about the role of the software developer and the raise of AI in general, my profile while it was very attractive in previous years, its not as important anymore, especially when using AI, different devs can use new stacks easily, even being specialist with a specific stack is not that required by the market.

Taking into account this [tweet](https://x.com/armankhon/status/1873410295458361713) from Arman Khon, an AI/ML engineer from Microsoft, he suggests developers to try and transition more into that role and is something I have been considering, shifting from coding which can be done using AI with our supervision since its not even close to perfect, to thinking about system design itself, can make your profile standout more than a coding bot which is what most companies usually think of you.

Its why I decided to create a roadmap to transition into this role, even though I be still working as a Developer, I will be learning this new skill which could come handy for the future.

# **Roadmap for Transitioning to Data or Machine Learning Role**

## **Phase 1: Foundation Building (0-3 Months)**

**Goals: Establish a strong foundation in data analysis and programming.**

## **Skills to Acquire:**

- **Python**: Start with basic syntax, data structures, and libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
- **SQL**: Learn how to query databases, focusing on data extraction and manipulation.
- **Statistics**: Understand basic statistical concepts and their applications in data analysis.

## **Actions:**

- Enroll in online courses for Python and SQL (e.g., Coursera, Udemy).
- Complete exercises on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank to practice coding skills.
- Read introductory materials on statistics relevant to data science.

## **Phase 2: Intermediate Skills Development (3-6 Months)**

**Goals: Gain proficiency in machine learning concepts and tools.**

## **Skills to Acquire:**

- **Machine Learning Basics**: Learn about supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- **Data Visualization**: Familiarize yourself with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **R** (optional): If interested in statistical analysis, start learning R.

## **Actions:**

- Take a machine learning course (e.g., Andrew Ng's course on Coursera).
- Work on small projects that involve building basic ML models using Scikit-learn.
- Create visualizations of datasets using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## **Phase 3: Advanced Skills and Projects (6-12 Months)**

**Goals: Build real-world projects that showcase data analysis and ML skills.**

## **Skills to Acquire:**

- **ML Frameworks**: Learn TensorFlow or PyTorch for building more complex models.
- **Big Data Technologies**: Familiarize yourself with tools like Apache Spark if interested in large datasets.
- **Cloud Computing**: Understand how to deploy models using AWS or Google Cloud.

## **Actions:**

- Develop a portfolio of projects that include:
  - Data cleaning and analysis projects using Python and SQL.
  - Machine learning models that solve specific problems (e.g., predictive modeling).
  - Interactive dashboards showcasing insights from data using Dash or Streamlit.
- Contribute to open-source projects related to data science or ML.

## **Phase 4: Networking and Job Search (12+ Months)**

**Goals: Connect with professionals in the field and apply for data/ML roles.**

## **Actions:**

- Attend meetups, webinars, and conferences focused on data science and machine learning.
- Engage with online communities (e.g., LinkedIn groups, Kaggle forums) to network with industry professionals.
- Update your LinkedIn profile and resume to reflect new skills and projects.
- Apply for entry-level data analyst or machine learning positions, emphasizing your frontend experience as a unique asset.

# Conclusion

This roadmap provides me with a structured approach to transitioning into a data or machine learning role. By focusing on acquiring relevant skills, building a portfolio of projects, and engaging with the community, I can effectively position myself for success in this growing field.

See you on the next post.

Sincerely,

**Eng. Adrian Beria.**
